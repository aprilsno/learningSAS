# Learning SAS

This file contains lab assignments completed for BIOS511: Introduction to Statistical Computing and Data Management at UNC Chapel Hill in Fall 2021. This course was an introduction to SAS programming.

The objectives of this course were:
1. To prepare students for the SAS programming they will do in more advanced Biostatistics courses, in their research and GRA assignments, and, later, in their employment.
2. To delineate the basic tasks and goals of statistical computing and research data management, and to have students learn by experience how SAS can help to perform those tasks and achieve those goals.
3. To develop the ability to write simple to moderately complex SAS programs from scratch with minimal external resources.
